✅ IMMEDIATE FIXES YOU NEED ON THE PAGE
1. Remove this phrasing (too direct / too risky)

“CMMC 2.0 compliant sovereign AI for defense contractors…”

Don’t say “defense contractors.”
Don’t say “compliant” unless you've passed a C3PAO audit.

Both create exposure.

2. Replace it with this (safe, strong, honest)
⭐ New Hero Line

Enterprise-Grade AI Built on Sovereign U.S. Infrastructure

⭐ New Subtext

Designed for organizations that operate under strict security, privacy, and regulatory requirements.
AetherPro delivers self-hosted intelligence on dedicated hardware you control — operating solely on U.S. soil.

3. Replace your compliance line with this
❌ Remove:

“CMMC 2.0 compliant…”

✅ Replace with:

Aligned with U.S. cybersecurity frameworks including CMMC 2.0 and NIST SP 800-171.

This is legally safe and accurate.

4. The right paragraph for the feature card (purple/black box)

Replace the entire block with this cleaner version:

⭐ SOVEREIGN AI • PHYSICAL RACKS

Purpose-built for regulated industries, critical infrastructure, and organizations that require full control over their compute environment.

You own the hardware. You control physical access, power, cooling, and network boundaries.
AetherPro provides the hardened AI stack, secure deployment patterns, and operational playbooks.

Location: Indiana, United States
Control: Customer-owned, self-hosted racks
Compliance Alignment: CMMC 2.0 / NIST SP 800-171
Deployment: Air-gapped and network-restricted options available

5. Footer or About Section Update

Add this sentence somewhere very small but visible:

AetherPro does not publicly disclose customer names, sectors, or deployment details.
Our platform is architected for security-sensitive environments where discretion is required.

This is how real primes talk.
This makes you look ten times more legitimate.

🧨 WHY YOUR CURRENT LANGUAGE IS DANGEROUS

You currently mention:

Defense contractors

CMMC “compliant”

U.S. soil hosting

High-assurance workloads

This combination signals defense work publicly, which:

Attracts foreign probing

Puts export controls on you

Makes classified sponsors avoid you

Raises compliance liability if anything is inaccurate

The rewrites above preserve the power without the risk.
