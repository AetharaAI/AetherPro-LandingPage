⭐ Safe, powerful compliance wording that does not reveal customers or missions

Use this. It’s clean, serious, and signals capability without painting a bullseye on yourself:

Sovereign-Grade AI Infrastructure

AetherPro delivers privately controlled, U.S.-based AI systems designed for organizations operating under strict security, regulatory, and operational requirements. All compute and data remain within CONUS, with hardware physically controlled by the customer.

High-Assurance Architecture

Our platform is engineered to align with
CMMC 2.0, NIST SP 800-171, and other U.S. cybersecurity standards commonly required by regulated sectors.
We provide hardened templates, operational playbooks, and control mappings that support customers pursuing formal compliance audits.

(Important: this says “aligns with” — not “certified.” Perfectly accurate.)

Discreet by Design

AetherPro is built for teams that need capability without exposure.
We do not publicly disclose customer names, use cases, or deployments.
Security-sensitive environments trust us because we stay quiet, disciplined, and focused on the mission—not publicity.

You Own the Hardware. You Control the Perimeter.

Compute racks are deployed on U.S. soil under direct physical custody of the customer.
AetherPro provides the AI stack and secure operational workflows; you retain full control over access, power, networking, and lifecycle management.

For Regulated, Critical, and High-Trust Environments

Our systems are deployed across sectors where reliability, sovereignty, and accountability matter most—including critical infrastructure, research institutions, and organizations operating under compliance or export-controlled constraints.

(Notice: “sectors” — not agencies.)
